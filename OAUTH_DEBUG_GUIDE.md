### ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX - Update Supabase Site URL

**Go to this exact page**:
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dspwgwivmqvyskikbfdq/auth/url-configuration
```

### Check These Settings:

#### 1. **Site URL** (MUST BE EXACT):
```
https://13la7e.github.io/ReHome/#/
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Include the trailing slash!**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Include /ReHome/#/ not just /ReHome/**

#### 2. **Redirect URLs** (Add ALL of these):
```
https://13la7e.github.io/ReHome/**
https://13la7e.github.io/ReHome/#/
https://13la7e.github.io/ReHome/#/auth
https://13la7e.github.io/**
http://localhost:8080/ReHome/**
http://localhost:8080/ReHome/#/
http://localhost:8080/ReHome/#/auth
```

## üß™ Test After Fixing Site URL

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Delete**
2. Clear "Cookies and other site data"
3. Clear "Cached images and files"
4. Time range: **All time**
5. Click "Clear data"

### Step 2: Open Incognito/Private Window
- Chrome: **Ctrl + Shift + N**
- Firefox: **Ctrl + Shift + P**
- Edge: **Ctrl + Shift + N**

### Step 3: Test Google OAuth
1. Go to: https://13la7e.github.io/ReHome/#/auth
2. Open browser console (**F12**)
3. Go to "Console" tab
4. Click "Continue with Google"
5. Select your Google account
6. **Watch the console logs**

### Step 4: Check Console Logs
You should see:
```
Auth state change: SIGNED_IN user@email.com
Initial session: user@email.com
```

If you see those logs, OAuth is working!

## üêõ Other Possible Issues

### Issue 1: Google OAuth Credentials Wrong
**Check**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dspwgwivmqvyskikbfdq/auth/providers

Make sure:
- ‚úÖ Google is enabled (toggle is ON)
- ‚úÖ Client ID: [Your Google OAuth Client ID from Google Console]
- ‚úÖ Client Secret: [Your Google OAuth Client Secret from Google Console]
- ‚úÖ Click "Save"

### Issue 2: Google Console Redirect URI
**Check**: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

Find your OAuth client and verify **Authorized redirect URIs**:
```
https://dspwgwivmqvyskikbfdq.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```

Should be EXACTLY that. Click "Save" if you change it.

### Issue 3: Session Not Persisting
**Check localStorage**:
1. Open console (**F12**)
2. Go to "Application" tab (Chrome) or "Storage" tab (Firefox)
3. Look under "Local Storage" ‚Üí your site URL
4. Look for keys starting with `sb-`
5. If empty after OAuth, there's a session storage issue

## üîß Quick Debug Script

Run this in your browser console AFTER trying Google sign-in:

```javascript
// Check if we have a session
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
console.log('Session:', session);
console.log('User:', session?.user?.email);

// Check localStorage
console.log('LocalStorage keys:', Object.keys(localStorage).filter(k => k.includes('sb-')));

// Try to get user
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
console.log('Current user:', user?.email);
```

If session is `null`, OAuth didn't complete successfully.
